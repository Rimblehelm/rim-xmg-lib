[![Docs Website](https://img.shields.io/website?down_color=red&down_message=offline&up_color=green&up_message=online&url=https://rimblehelm.github.io/rim-xmg-lib/)](https://rimblehelm.github.io/rim-xmg-lib/)

A small TypeScript utility library for parsing Coin Magi (XMG) blocks and transactions.

## Quick start

Install and build:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Generate API docs locally:

```bash
npm run docs
# docs will be generated to ./docs
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will also build and publish docs to GitHub Pages on push to `main` (or `master`) and on pull requests.

### GitHub Pages badge

Add the following badge to the top of your README to point to published docs (replace USERNAME/REPO):

`[![Docs](https://img.shields.io/website?down_color=red&down_message=offline&up_color=green&up_message=online&url=https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO/)](https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO/)`

## Example usage

Basic example in TypeScript:

```ts
import { XMGTransaction } from 'rim-xmg-lib';
import { XMGWallet } from 'rim-xmg-lib';

const txJson = `{"txid":"abc123","version":1,"time":1600000000,"locktime":0,"vin":[],"vout":[]}`;
const tx = XMGTransaction.fromJSON(txJson);
console.log(tx.ID); // 'abc123'

const wallet = new XMGWallet({ address: 'Xx...', createdAt: new Date(), transactions: [] });
console.log(wallet.balance); // 0 (no transactions)
```

Default-import example (backwards compatible):

```ts
import rim from 'rim-xmg-lib';

const txJson = `{"txid":"def456","version":1,"time":1600000000,"locktime":0,"vin":[],"vout":[]}`;
const tx = rim.XMGTransaction.fromJSON(txJson);
console.log(tx.ID);
```

## Examples

Examples are located under `examples/`. TypeDoc is configured to include the `examples` entry point so they will be rendered in the generated docs. See `examples/transaction-example.ts` for a small demo script.

## Contributing

- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` before committing.
- Docs are automatically generated by GitHub Actions and published to the `gh-pages` branch.

If you'd like me to add a GitHub Pages badge to the README or to generate a docs index with some examples, I can do that next.
